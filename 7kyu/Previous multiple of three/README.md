# Previous multiple of three

Given a positive integer n: 0 < n < 1e6, remove the last digit until you're left with a number that is a multiple of three.

Return n if the input is already a multiple of three, and return null/nil/None if no such number exists.

Examples

```javascript
1      => null
25     => null
36     => 36
1244   => 12
952406 => 9
```
