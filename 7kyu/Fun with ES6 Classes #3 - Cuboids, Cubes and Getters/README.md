# Fun with ES6 Classes #3 - Cuboids, Cubes and Getters

### Task

Define the following classes.

### I. Cuboid

The object constructor for the class Cuboid should receive exactly three arguments in the following order: length, width, height and store these three values in this.length, this.width and this.height respectively.

The class Cuboid should then have a getter surfaceArea which returns the surface area of the cuboid and a getter volume which returns the volume of the cuboid.

### II. Cube

class Cube is a subclass of class Cuboid. The constructor function of Cube should receive one argument only, its length, and use that value passed in to set this.length, this.width and this.height.

Hint: Make a call to super, passing in the correct arguments, to make life easier ;)
