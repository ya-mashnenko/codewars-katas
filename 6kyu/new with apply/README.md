# new with apply

In JavaScript we can create objects using the `new` operator.

For example, if you have this constructor function:

```javascript
function Greeting(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Greeting.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  return "Hello " + this.name;
};

Greeting.prototype.sayBye = function () {
  return "Bye " + this.name;
};
```

You can create a Greeting object in this way:

```javascript
var greeting = new Greeting("John");
```

new operator is evil because it produces a highly coupled code, difficult to maintain and test.

Some patterns to reduce coupling are object factories or dependency injection.

These patterns can benefit of the `construct()` function.

This function receives a constructor function and possibly some arguments and it returns a new object constructed with the function and the passed arguments.

This is another way to create the `greeting` object:

```javascript
var greeting = construct(Greeting, "John");
```

And a factory could use like this:

```javascript
  function factory() {
    return {
      createGreeting() {
        return construct(Greeting, arguments);
      }
      ...
    }
  }
```

Your work is to implement the `construct()` function.
